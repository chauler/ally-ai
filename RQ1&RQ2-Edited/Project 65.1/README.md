ChatGPT created web component for school assignment

Here's the link to the github page: [https://leifmessinger.github.io/ChatGPTTimerWebComponent.github.io/](https://leifmessinger.github.io/ChatGPTTimerWebComponent.github.io/)

You can blame that outdated github gist for the weird URL.

[Here's a link to the ChatGPT conversation](https://chat.openai.com/share/3e30f035-bb9d-42f4-9abb-0cc0f6702cec)

I did some minor tweaks. The chatbot couldn't paste this line back in, even when I asked.
```js
this.playPauseButton.textContent = this.isPlaying ? 'üîÑ' : '‚ñ∂Ô∏è';
```
It also made the refresh button the default button, so I changed it back to ‚ñ∂Ô∏è.

It also couldn't make the text and buttons scalable to the size of the component.
