Here are some accessibility issues I found in the provided HTML code:
- Snippet with error:

<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        ...
    </ul>
</nav>

Location of error: Navigation Bar
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)
Detection Algorithm: Checking if the href attribute of anchor tags contains meaningful URLs.
Explanation of Error: The anchor tags within the navigation bar have href="#" which does not provide a valid destination. This can be confusing for users, especially those using screen readers.
- Snippet with error:

<button onmousedown="addToCart('ComfortFitTShirt')">Add to Cart</button>

Location of error: Featured Products Section, Product 1
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.1.1 Keyboard
Detection Algorithm: Checking if interactive elements have keyboard-accessible event handlers.
Explanation of Error: The button uses the onmousedown event which may not be triggered by keyboard inputs. It's recommended to use onclick instead to ensure keyboard accessibility.
- Snippet with error:

<section id="video-container" onmouseout="PauseVideo()">

Location of error: Video Section
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.1.1 Keyboard
Detection Algorithm: Checking if interactive elements have keyboard-accessible event handlers.
Explanation of Error: The onmouseout event may not be triggered by keyboard inputs. It's recommended to provide an alternative control for pausing the video that is keyboard accessible.
- Snippet with error:

<label for="email">Email:</label>
<label for="email">Email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email">

Location of error: Contact Section
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Detection Algorithm: Checking if form inputs have only one associated label.
Explanation of Error: The email input field has two associated labels. This can be confusing for screen reader users. Ensure each form input has only one associated label.
Please note that this analysis is based on the provided HTML code and does not take into account any scripts or stylesheets that may affect the accessibility of the page. It's also recommended to use an automated tool to perform a more comprehensive accessibility audit.

## Copilot
Sure, here are some additional accessibility issues I found in the provided HTML code:
- Snippet with error:

<img src="product1.jpg" alt="Product 1">

Location of error: Featured Products Section, Product 1
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.1.1 Non-text Content
Detection Algorithm: Checking if alt attributes provide meaningful descriptions.
Explanation of Error: The alt attribute of the image is "Product 1", which does not provide a meaningful description of the image content. A more descriptive alt text should be used.
- Snippet with error:

<input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Your name">

Location of error: Contact Section
WCAG Guideline violated: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions
Detection Algorithm: Checking if form inputs have associated labels.
Explanation of Error: The input field for name does not have an associated label. This can make it difficult for screen reader users to understand what information should be entered in this field.
- Snippet with error:

<section id="video-container" onmouseout="PauseVideo()">

Location of error: Video Section
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide
Detection Algorithm: Checking if media elements have accessible controls.
Explanation of Error: The video container has an onmouseout event to pause the video, but there are no visible controls for pausing, stopping, or hiding the video. This can make it difficult for users to control the video playback.
- Snippet with error:

<footer>
    <p>&copy; 2023 Calvin Kelvin Products</p>
</footer>

Location of error: Footer Section
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.2 Page Titled
Detection Algorithm: Checking if the page has a meaningful and unique title.
Explanation of Error: The footer contains a copyright notice for 2023, but the current year is 2024. This can be confusing for users and may make the website appear outdated.
Please note that this analysis is based on the provided HTML code and does not take into account any scripts or stylesheets that may affect the accessibility of the page. It's also recommended to use an automated tool to perform a more comprehensive accessibility audit.
