Based on the provided HTML code, here are some accessibility issues that violate WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.2:

1. **Missing Aria-Label or Aria-Labelledby**: The form fields, such as input fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons, do not have an associated `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute. Adding an appropriate `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute will improve accessibility for users who rely on assistive technologies.

   Snippet with error: `<input>` elements in the form

   Location of error: Contact Form section

   WCAG Guideline violated: 3.3 Input Modalities

   Detection Algorithm: Screen reader algorithms and other assistive technologies rely on labels to understand the purpose of form fields.

2. **Missing Form Field Labels**: The form fields do not have associated labels. Adding labels to the form fields will improve accessibility.

   Snippet with error: `<input>` elements in the form

   Location of error: Contact Form section

   WCAG Guideline violated: 3.3 Input Modalities

   Detection Algorithm: Screen reader algorithms and other assistive technologies rely on labels to understand the purpose of form fields.

3. **Missing Aria-Label or Aria-Labelledby**: The video element does not have an associated `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute. Adding an appropriate `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute will improve accessibility for users who rely on assistive technologies.

   Snippet with error: `<video>` element

   Location of error: Video about the Bookstore section

   WCAG Guideline violated: 3.3 Input Modalities

   Detection Algorithm: Screen reader algorithms and other assistive technologies rely on labels to understand the purpose of form fields.

4. **Missing Form Field Labels**: The form fields do not have associated labels. Adding labels to the form fields will improve accessibility.

   Snippet with error: `<input>` elements in the form

   Location of error: Contact Form section

   WCAG Guideline violated: 3.3 Input Modalities

   Detection Algorithm: Screen reader algorithms and other assistive technologies rely on labels to understand the purpose of form fields.

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of accessibility issues, and it's always recommended to conduct a thorough accessibility audit using automated tools and manual testing to identify all potential issues.
