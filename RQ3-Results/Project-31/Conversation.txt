Context: You are an accessibility expert reviewing HTML for accessibility issues. Analyze the following code in the context of WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.2, listing any issues that may violate these guidelines. You will only be analyzing the HTML, ignoring any included or missing styles and scripts.

## Copilot
Snippet with error: <marquee>Ticket Booking System</marquee>
Location of error: Inside the <header> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: The <marquee> element is deprecated and it creates content that moves or auto-updates and can be distracting. It does not provide a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it which violates WCAG guideline 2.2.2.
Snippet with error: <a href="#">Home</a> <a href="#">Movies</a> <a href="#">Events</a> <a href="#">Contact</a>
Location of error: Inside the <nav> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: The links in the navigation do not have a valid href attribute. They should lead to the appropriate content when clicked. Using # as the href value does not provide a clear purpose of the link when taken out of context, which violates WCAG guideline 2.4.4.
Snippet with error: <label for="event"></label>
Location of error: Inside the <form> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: The label for the "event" select element is empty. Labels should provide descriptive text that identifies the component's purpose, which is not the case here, violating WCAG guideline 1.3.1.
Snippet with error: <input type="number" alt="quantity" id="quantity" name="quantity" min="1" required>
Location of error: Inside the <form> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: The alt attribute is not valid for input elements. Screen readers use the associated <label> element to identify the input's purpose. The misuse of the alt attribute here violates WCAG guideline 4.1.2.
Snippet with error: <button type="button" onclick="submitForm()" style="background-color: #45a049;">
Location of error: Inside the <form> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: The form submission is controlled by a script tied to the onclick event of the button. This means that the form cannot be submitted by keyboard alone (e.g., by pressing Enter), which violates WCAG guideline 2.1.1. The button should be of type "submit" to allow form submission via the keyboard.
Please note that these are potential issues and might not be actual accessibility problems depending on the full context, user needs, and how the rest of the website is built. It's always best to involve users with disabilities in testing for the best results.

Sure, here are some additional potential issues:
Snippet with error: <body style="background: url('background.jpg') no-repeat center center fixed;">
Location of error: Inside the <body> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.4.5 Images of Text (Level AA)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: If the background image contains text, it may not be accessible to all users, such as those with visual impairments or color blindness. It's recommended to use actual text that can be styled with CSS for better accessibility.
Snippet with error: <button type="button" onclick="submitForm()" style="background-color: #45a049;">
Location of error: Inside the <form> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 3.2.2 On Input (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: The form submission is controlled by a script tied to the onclick event of the button. This means that the form cannot be submitted by keyboard alone (e.g., by pressing Enter), which violates WCAG guideline 3.2.2. The button should be of type "submit" to allow form submission via the keyboard.
Snippet with error: <div id="confirmation" style="display:none;">
Location of error: Inside the <section> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: The div element with id "confirmation" is initially hidden with display: none;. If this content is meant to be shown to the user at some point (e.g., after form submission), it should be made accessible to assistive technologies. For example, it could have an ARIA role and be shown/hidden using ARIA states.
Snippet with error: <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
Location of error: Inside the <form> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: The input field for "name" is marked as required, but there is no indication of this in the label or instructions. This could make the form difficult to use for people who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies.
Please note that these are potential issues and might not be actual accessibility problems depending on the full context, user needs, and how the rest of the website is built. It's always best to involve users with disabilities in testing for the best results. Also, remember that WCAG is just one set of guidelines and does not cover all possible accessibility issues. It's important to consider other best practices and standards, such as the ARIA Authoring Practices, for a more comprehensive approach to web accessibility.

## Copilot
Absolutely, here are some additional potential issues:
Snippet with error: <html lang="en">
Location of error: At the start of the HTML document
WCAG Guideline violated: 3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: The lang attribute on the <html> element is set to "en" (English). If the actual content of the page is not in English, this can cause confusion for screen readers and other assistive technologies, which use this attribute to determine how to pronounce and interpret the content.
Snippet with error: <style>...</style>
Location of error: Inside the <head> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: The CSS styles defined in the <style> block set the text color to white (#fff) and the background color to a semi-transparent black (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)). Depending on the background image, this may not provide sufficient contrast for the text, making it difficult to read for users with low vision or color blindness.
Snippet with error: <form id="bookingForm">...</form>
Location of error: Inside the <section> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 3.3.1 Error Identification (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: The form does not provide any mechanism for identifying and describing errors in the input. When the user submits the form, any validation errors should be identified and described to the user in text.
Snippet with error: <script>...</script>
Location of error: Inside the <body> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Manual inspection
Explanation of Error: The JavaScript code in the <script> block controls the display of the form and the confirmation message. However, it does not provide any keyboard-accessible way to return to the form after the confirmation message is displayed. This can make the page difficult to use for keyboard-only users.
Please note that these are potential issues and might not be actual accessibility problems depending on the full context, user needs, and how the rest of the website is built. It's always best to involve users with disabilities in testing for the best results. Also, remember that WCAG is just one set of guidelines and does not cover all possible accessibility issues. It's important to consider other best practices and standards, such as the ARIA Authoring Practices, for a more comprehensive approach to web accessibility.
