Here are the accessibility issues I found in your HTML code:
- Snippet with error: <input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd">
Location of error: In the "Contact Us" form.
WCAG Guideline violated: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Checking if form inputs have associated labels.
Explanation of Error: The password input field is missing a label. This can make it difficult for screen reader users to understand what information should be entered in this field.
