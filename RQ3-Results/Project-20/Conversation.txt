## Copilot
Here are the accessibility issues I found in your HTML code:
- Snippet with error: <html lang="tx">
Location of error: html element
WCAG Guideline violated: 3.1.1 Language of Page
Detection Algorithm: Checking if the lang attribute value is a valid language code.
Explanation of Error: The lang attribute in the html tag should contain a valid language code. "tx" is not a recognized language code.
- Snippet with error: <button>Learn More
Location of error: button element in the #home section
WCAG Guideline violated: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
Detection Algorithm: Checking if the button tag is properly closed.
Explanation of Error: The button tag is not properly closed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior in different browsers and assistive technologies.
- Snippet with error: <label for="password"></label><br><input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd">
Location of error: label and input elements in the #contact section
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Detection Algorithm: Checking if the for attribute in the label tag matches the id of an input field, and if the label contains text.
Explanation of Error: The label for the password input field is empty and its for attribute does not match the id of the input field. This can make it difficult for screen reader users to understand what input is expected.
- Snippet with error: <input type="radio" id="1" name="fav_number" value="1">
Location of error: input element in the #contact section
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Detection Algorithm: Checking if input elements of type radio have associated label elements.
Explanation of Error: The radio button does not have an associated label. This can make it difficult for screen reader users to understand the purpose of the radio button.
- Snippet with error: <video controls><source src="hospital-tour.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
Location of error: video element in the #video section
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded)
Detection Algorithm: Checking if video elements have captions.
Explanation of Error: The video element does not have captions provided through track elements. This can make it difficult for people who are deaf or hard of hearing to understand the video content.
Please note that this analysis is based on the provided HTML code and does not take into account any dynamic changes that might occur through JavaScript or other means. It's also important to manually check the website with various assistive technologies to ensure full accessibility.

Are there any more issues? List all that you find.
## Copilot
Sure, here are some additional accessibility issues I found in your HTML code:
- Snippet with error: <div id="container">
Location of error: div elements in the #home, #services, #video, and #contact sections
WCAG Guideline violated: 4.1.1 Parsing
Detection Algorithm: Checking if id attributes are unique within the document.
Explanation of Error: The id attribute "container" is used multiple times in the document. id attributes must be unique within a document to ensure that they can be used reliably in scripts and for accessibility purposes.
- Snippet with error: <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">
Location of error: input elements in the #contact section
WCAG Guideline violated: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions
Detection Algorithm: Checking if input elements of type checkbox have associated label elements.
Explanation of Error: The checkbox inputs do not have an associated label. This can make it difficult for screen reader users to understand the purpose of the checkbox.
- Snippet with error: <input type="file" id="myfile" name="myfile">
Location of error: input element in the #contact section
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Detection Algorithm: Checking if input elements of type file have associated label elements.
Explanation of Error: The file input does not have an associated label. This can make it difficult for screen reader users to understand the purpose of the input field.
- Snippet with error: <header><h1>Your Hospital Name</h1><p>Welcome to our state-of-the-art healthcare facility</p></header>
Location of error: header element
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)
Detection Algorithm: Checking if the contrast ratio between text color and background color meets the minimum requirement.
Explanation of Error: The text color (#fff) on the background image may not meet the minimum contrast ratio requirement of 4.5:1 for normal text. This can make the text difficult to read for people with moderately low vision.
- Snippet with error: <nav><a href="#home">Home</a>...<a href="#contact">Contact</a></nav>
Location of error: nav element
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
Detection Algorithm: Checking if the page provides a means to bypass repeated blocks of content.
Explanation of Error: The page does not provide a "Skip to main content" link or similar mechanism to bypass the navigation. This can make it difficult for keyboard and screen reader users to access the main content.
Please note that this analysis is based on the provided HTML code and does not take into account any dynamic changes that might occur through JavaScript or other means. It's also important to manually check the website with various assistive technologies to ensure full accessibility. Also, please remember that accessibility is not just about adhering to standards but about ensuring a good user experience for all users. It's always a good idea to involve real users in testing for accessibility.

Sure, here are some additional accessibility issues I found in your HTML code:
- Snippet with error: <nav><a href="#home">Home</a>...<a href="#contact">Contact</a></nav>
Location of error: nav element
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)
Detection Algorithm: Checking if the link text is meaningful out of context.
Explanation of Error: The link text "Home", "Services", "Departments", and "Contact" may not be meaningful out of context. Screen reader users often navigate through links out of context, so it's important to ensure that link text is meaningful on its own.
- Snippet with error: <video controls><source src="hospital-tour.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
Location of error: video element in the #video section
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded)
Detection Algorithm: Checking if video elements have audio descriptions provided through track elements.
Explanation of Error: The video element does not have audio descriptions provided through track elements. This can make it difficult for people who are blind or have low vision to understand the video content.
- Snippet with error: <form>...</form>
Location of error: form element in the #contact section
WCAG Guideline violated: 3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)
Detection Algorithm: Checking if form elements that cause legal commitments or financial transactions have mechanisms to prevent, identify, and correct errors.
Explanation of Error: The form does not have mechanisms to prevent, identify, and correct errors. This can make it difficult for users to avoid and correct mistakes when filling out the form.
- Snippet with error: <footer><p>&copy; 2023 Your Hospital Name. All rights reserved.</p></footer>
Location of error: footer element
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.5 Multiple Ways
Detection Algorithm: Checking if there are multiple ways to access web pages on the website.
Explanation of Error: The footer does not provide multiple ways to access other web pages on the website. This can make it difficult for users to navigate and find content.
Please note that this analysis is based on the provided HTML code and does not take into account any dynamic changes that might occur through JavaScript or other means. It's also important to manually check the website with various assistive technologies to ensure full accessibility.
