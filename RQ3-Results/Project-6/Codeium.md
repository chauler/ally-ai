Snippet with error: `<video autoplay>`

Location of error: `<!-- Video Section -->`

WCAG Guideline violated: 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Mute

Detection Algorithm: The `<video>` element with the `autoplay` attribute is used to automatically start playing a video. This can be problematic for users who may not want the video to start playing automatically or may have difficulty controlling the video.

Explanation of Error: Autoplaying videos can be disruptive to users who are in meetings, watching movies, or in other situations where sound is not desired. Additionally, users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies may not be able to control the video playback. It is recommended to provide users with the ability to control when and how videos are played. This can be done by removing the `autoplay` attribute and adding a play button or other controls to the video element.

Sure, here are some additional issues I found in the code:

1. Snippet with error: `<nav>`
   Location of error: `<!-- Navigation Bar -->`
   WCAG Guideline violated: 3.2.1 On Focus
   Detection Algorithm: The navigation bar does not have a focus outline when the user tabs to it. This can make it difficult for users who rely on keyboard navigation to navigate the site.
   Explanation of Error: Adding a focus outline to the navigation bar can help users navigate the site more easily. This can be done by adding the `tabindex` attribute to the `<nav>` element and setting it to `0`. Additionally, adding a CSS rule to the navigation bar can help users understand that it is interactive. For example, you can add the following CSS rule:
