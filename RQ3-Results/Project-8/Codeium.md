Based on the provided HTML code, here are some potential accessibility issues that violate WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.2:

1. **Missing Title**: The `title` element is empty. Providing a descriptive title for the webpage will improve accessibility.

   Snippet with error: `<title></title>`

   Location of error: `head` section

   WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.2 Page Titled

   Detection Algorithm: Screen reader algorithms and other assistive technologies rely on the title to describe the purpose of the page.

2. **Insufficient Contrast for Text**: The text color and background color combination in the header section may not have sufficient contrast. Ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background helps users with low vision to read the content easily.

   Snippet with error: `<header>` section

   Location of error: `header` section

   WCAG Guideline violated: 1.4.1 Use of Color

   Detection Algorithm: Color contrast checker tools can help identify if the contrast is sufficient.

3. **Missing Link Text**: The navigation links do not have descriptive text. Adding descriptive text for the links will improve accessibility.

   Snippet with error: `<nav>` section

   Location of error: `nav` section

   WCAG Guideline violated: 4.1 Focus Visible

   Detection Algorithm: Screen reader algorithms and other assistive technologies rely on link text to understand the purpose of the link.

4. **Missing Alternative Text for Images**: The video element does not have an alternative text. Providing alternative text for multimedia elements helps users with visual impairments understand the content.

   Snippet with error: `<video>` element

   Location of error: `video` element

   WCAG Guideline violated: 1.1.1 Non-text Content

   Detection Algorithm: Screen reader algorithms and other assistive technologies rely on alternative text to understand multimedia content.

5. **Missing Focus Styles**: The links in the navigation bar do not have any styles applied when they receive focus. Providing visual cues for focus will improve accessibility.

   Snippet with error: `<nav>` section

   Location of error: `nav` section

   WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.7 Focus Visible

   Detection Algorithm: Screen reader algorithms and other assistive technologies rely on visual cues to understand the focus state of elements.

6. **Missing Clear Focus**: The links in the navigation bar do not have a clear focus state. Providing a clear focus state will improve accessibility.

Based on the provided HTML code, here are additional potential accessibility issues that violate WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.2:

7. **Empty Anchor Text**: The first navigation link has an empty anchor text. All anchor links should have descriptive text to provide context to users.

   Snippet with error: `<a href="#home"></a>`

   Location of error: Inside the `nav` section

   WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)

   Detection Algorithm: Screen reader algorithms and other assistive technologies rely on anchor text to understand the purpose of the link.

8. **Meta Refresh Tag**: The `meta` tag with `http-equiv="refresh"` and content set to 0 can be disruptive to users, especially those using screen readers or keyboard navigation. It may interfere with user control and navigation.

   Snippet with error: `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0">`

   Location of error: Inside the `body` section

   WCAG Guideline violated: 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable

   Detection Algorithm: The `meta` tag with `refresh` can automatically redirect users, which can be confusing and disorienting.

These additional issues should be addressed to improve the overall accessibility of the webpage.

9. **Missing Alternative Text for Images**: The video element does not have an alternative text. Providing alternative text for multimedia elements helps users with visual impairments understand the content.

   Snippet with error: `<video>` element

   Location of error: Inside the `video` element

   WCAG Guideline violated: 1.1.1 Non-text Content

   Detection Algorithm: Screen reader algorithms and other assistive technologies rely on alternative text to understand multimedia content.

10. **Missing Focus Styles**: The links in the navigation bar do not have any styles applied when they receive focus. Providing visual cues for focus will improve accessibility.

    Snippet with error: `<nav>` section

    Location of error: Inside the `nav` section

    WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.7 Focus Visible

    Detection Algorithm: Screen reader algorithms and other assistive technologies rely on visual cues to understand the focus state of elements.

11. **Missing Clear Focus**: The links in the navigation bar do not have a clear focus state. Providing a clear focus state will improve accessibility.

    Snippet with error: `<nav>` section

    Location of error: Inside the `nav` section

    WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.7 Focus Visible

    Detection Algorithm: Screen reader algorithms and other assistive technologies rely on visual cues to understand the focus state of elements.

12. **Missing Heading Levels**: The page does not have any heading elements (`h1` to `h6`). Providing appropriate heading levels will improve the structure and organization of the content.

    Snippet with error: None

    Location of error: Outside the `body` section

    WCAG Guideline violated: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships

    Detection Algorithm: Headings provide structure and organization to the content, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the page.

These additional issues should also be addressed to improve the overall accessibility of the webpage.
