Here are the accessibility issues I found in the provided HTML code:
- Snippet with error: <marquee>Welcome to our Indian Cuisine Restaurant</marquee>
Location of error: Inside the <header> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Checking for deprecated HTML elements
Explanation of Error: The <marquee> tag is deprecated and it creates content that moves which can be distracting for some users. It also doesn't provide a mechanism to pause, stop, or hide the moving content.
- Snippet with error: <label for="sort"></label>
Location of error: Before the <select> tag for sorting filters
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Checking for empty <label> tags
Explanation of Error: The <label> tag is empty. It should provide a description for the associated control for better accessibility.
- Snippet with error: <button>Add to Cart</button>
Location of error: Inside each .item div in the .menu div
WCAG Guideline violated: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Checking for interactive elements without unique identifiers
Explanation of Error: The 'Add to Cart' buttons do not have unique identifiers. This can make it difficult for assistive technologies to differentiate between the buttons.
- Snippet with error: <form>...</form>
Location of error: Inside the <footer> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Checking for form controls without associated labels
Explanation of Error: The form controls for favorite number and vehicles do not have associated labels. This can make it difficult for users to understand the purpose of these controls.
- Snippet with error: <label for="myfile"></label>
Location of error: Before the <input type="file"> tag in the form inside the <footer> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Checking for empty <label> tags
Explanation of Error: The <label> tag is empty. It should provide a description for the associated control for better accessibility.
Please note that this analysis is based on the provided HTML code and does not take into account any additional functionality provided by CSS or JavaScript. It's also important to conduct user testing with a variety of assistive technologies to ensure full accessibility.
## You
Are there any more issues? List all that you find.
## Copilot
Sure, here are some additional accessibility issues I found in the provided HTML code:
- Snippet with error: <img src="chicken_biryani.jpg" alt="Chicken Biryani">
Location of error: Inside each .item div in the .menu div
WCAG Guideline violated: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Checking for descriptive alt attributes
Explanation of Error: The alt attribute for the image should provide a description of the image, not just repeat the title. This helps screen readers provide a meaningful description to those who cannot see the image.
- Snippet with error: <form>...</form>
Location of error: Inside the <footer> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)
Detection Algorithm: Checking for form controls without associated labels
Explanation of Error: The form in the footer does not have a descriptive heading or label. This can make it difficult for users to understand the purpose of the form.
- Snippet with error: <nav>...</nav>
Location of error: At the beginning of the <body> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Checking for skip navigation links
Explanation of Error: There is no 'skip to main content' link at the beginning of the page. This is helpful for users who use screen readers or keyboard navigation, allowing them to bypass repetitive content like navigation links.
- Snippet with error: <input type="text" id="search" placeholder="Search">
Location of error: Inside the <form> tag for search field
WCAG Guideline violated: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Checking for form controls without associated labels
Explanation of Error: The search input field does not have an associated label. While it does have a placeholder, a label is necessary for screen readers to properly identify the field.
- Snippet with error: <button type="submit">Submit</button>
Location of error: Inside the <form> tag in the <footer> tag
WCAG Guideline violated: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Detection Algorithm: Checking for interactive elements without unique identifiers
Explanation of Error: The 'Submit' button does not have a unique identifier. This can make it difficult for assistive technologies to differentiate between the buttons.
Please note that this analysis is based on the provided HTML code and does not take into account any additional functionality provided by CSS or JavaScript. It's also important to conduct user testing with a variety of assistive technologies to ensure full accessibility.
